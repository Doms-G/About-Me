# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dominique!

I'm a **Software QA Engineer** with 2+ years of experience hunting bugs, writing test cases, and making sure software is served fresh and bug-free. Think of me as the final boss your bugs have to face.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 🧪 Manual Testing (my specialty!)
- 🐛 Bug Reporting & Defect Tracking
- 📋 Writing Test Cases & Test Plans
- 💬 Collaborating with Devs & Stakeholders
- 🛠️ Currently sharpening skills in:
  - Automation Testing (Selenium & friends)
  - BDD/TDD & Gherkin Syntax
  - CI/CD Concepts
  - SQL Queries for Validation

## 🧂 Why QA?

Because software (like food) should **never be undercooked**.  
I'm passionate about quality, clarity, and making sure users never get a "burnt" experience.  
I break things on purpose — so users don’t have to by accident.

## 🍜 A Few Personal Bits

- I love cooking. Seriously.  
- Debugging and seasoning? Both require patience.  
- I will ask “What happens if I click this?” and yes, I will click it.
